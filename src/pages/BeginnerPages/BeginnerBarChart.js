          A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical
          data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the
          values that they represent. A bar graph shows comparisons among
          discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific
          categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured
          value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than
          one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.

          It is a really good way to show relative sizes: we can see which types
          of movie are most liked, and which are least liked, at a glance. We
          can use bar graphs to show the relative sizes of many things, such as
          what type of car people have, how many customers a shop has on
          different days and so on.

          Bar Graphs are good when your data is in categories (such as "Comedy",
          "Drama", etc). But when you have continuous data (such as a person's
          height) then use a Histogram. It is best to leave gaps between the
          bars of a Bar Graph, so it doesn't look like a Histogram.
